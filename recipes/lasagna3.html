        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I thought this was a really good dish. We were looking for something a little different for Tex-Mex and this was perfect. I did add about double the lime juice and we didn’t have sour cream so I subbed Mascarpone and Greek Yogurt but it still turned out really good. I love sauce so I doubled it and did a two layer lasagna. Thanks for the recipe!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1/4-inch strips</li>
            <li>½ cup lime juice</li>
            <li>2 (1 ounce) packets taco seasoning mix (such as Old El Paso®)</li>
            <li>1½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1 cup salsa</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package no-boil lasagna noodles, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
